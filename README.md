#DigitalPec - Frontend

This work proposes the development of an integrated web system focused on facilitating the management of these farms as a financially accessible and technologically simplified alternative. The proposed system encompasses the automation of animal information management, including health and vaccination records, with the aim of optimizing resource management, reducing losses and increasing operational efficiency, promoting more organized and effective management. It is expected that, with the use of this system, producers will be able to integrate data in a way that allows for analysis and more informed decision-making, ensuring agile response to herd care and increasing production capacity.
